# Contributing

WIP - but here's the TL;DR

## Issues

- Please include the output from `nodemon --dump` for diagnosis
- If there's a script that nodemon is having trouble with or is causing nodemon to throw exceptions, please include it in your filed issue to allow me to replicate the issue.

## Sending pull requests

- use the .jshintrc (in the root of the project)
- new command line options are generally discouraged
- ensure style is consistent
- add tests for newly added code (and try to mirror directory and file structure if possible)
- spell check
